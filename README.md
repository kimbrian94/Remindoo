## Introduction
As the environments for work and school begin to change, we find ourselves with longer periods of time spending at home. While sitting in front of a desk all day, we often forget to meet the simplest bodily needs.

- It is well known that the recommended daily fluid intake is 3 litres, but we rarely drink more than one.
- Stretching not only gives you flexibility, but it also improves your mental state, as it reduces stress and releases tension.
- Ever feel like you're stuck in your task? Maybe it's a good idea to go for a walk to calm the mind and relieve some stress. You'll be recharged and ready again.

Remindoo will give you these reminders with alarms, and notifications as you work or study from home, to help you meet these essential bodily needs.
